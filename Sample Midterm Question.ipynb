    "# Sample Midterm Question\n",
    "\n",
    "On the midterm, there will be one question on maximum likelihood estimation (similar to Question 1 on Assignment 2) and one question on linear regression, which will require you to derive and to implement. Here is an example of a linear regression question. You should be able to solve this problem using techniques we learned in this class, even though you have not seen this specific example."
